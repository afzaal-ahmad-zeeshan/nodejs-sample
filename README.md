# Node.js Sample
This is a "live" repository of Node.js sample tutorial on YouTube. 

I will commit after every new video, and I will try (but not going to happen most likely) to post the video link in which I made the appropriate changes. Otherwise, I will post the links to commits and the video that contains the explanation of the code changes in this README file.

Although currently not as mature, I want to 

1. Give an overview of Node.js web app development
2. How to build templated web pages.
3. How to program databases in Node.js (SQLite 3 in this case)
4. How to host apps on other platforms, such as Azure, Heroku etc. 
5. Few tips and ending up.

Each time I post a video, I will make some changes and I will push those changes to the GitHub repository. I believe this can help developers in learning the overall structure of this app, as well as being able to understand how I wrote the code and most importantly _why_ I wrote that code. 

Thank you, 
Afzaal Ahmad Zeeshan.
